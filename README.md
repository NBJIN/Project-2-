#
## Introduction

<p align="justify">
On researching projects and javascript notes I reviewed a widely used game called "Whack A Mole" and decided to go with a similar idea for the project i am undertaking.  The game that i am building has a  slight twist on the "Whack A Mole" game.  I have decided to use a black cat instead of a mole and the game is called "Catch The Black Cat Game" instead of "Whack A Mole".  The goal is to provide people with a fun game that the player can spend a few minutes playing or spend a bit of time playing at the different levels.  The player can play at two different levels which are level easy and level hard. Level Easy gives the player 30 seconds and the rate that the cat appears at is 1000. Level Hard is where the player is given 20 seconds and a rate of 700 at which the cat displays.  When the player chooses the level and starts the game the countdown timer begins and successfull hits are recorded in the score section.  When the game finishes an alert message will be displayed to the user saying the game has finished and displys the total number of scores. The user can click ok on this message and then play the game again if they wish.

C. Color Scheme
<br>

The color scheme chosen for this background was as follows: 

- Black is the main background color.
- Orange is used for the majority of the text on the page, borders and highlighting the different level button when a game is in play.
- Red is used to show the time remaining and is also used as a hover effect over the close button in the instructions section. 
- Blue is used to show the score counter.
- The horizontal rule at the top and the bottom of the page have a fill color of darkslategray and an orange border. 
- The background color for the circles is again blackslategray and orange and these circles have an orange shadow effect and  sit on a blackslategray background.  
<br>

The color palette was done up on coolors.co website a link to this site is below along with a copy of the color palette.

<br>
<br>

D. Typography
<br>

The font that was chosen throughout this project is Montserrat.  It is a very clear font and is also easy to read in the selected font colors of orange, red and blue.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montserrat_(typeface)

A link to google fonts has also been included in the head section of the index.html file. 

https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300&display=swap 

The backup font which has been used is Arial again it is a very clear font and can be easily seen in the selected colors for this project.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial

The only exception is for the instructions section. Arial is used as the main font but if this should not be available there are fallback fonts of Helvetica and sans-serif.  Helvetica is a clear font and can be easily 
read with the colors on the website.   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica

Again sans-serif is a very clear font and easy to read.
